# Snappper
Screenshot utility that is always open -- just position the frame and click the snap icon

A Windows WPF application written in C# to take screenshots of what you're working on.  Here's what's unique about it:
* You can leave it open all the time and reposition the frame to exactly where you need it
* It has a built-in size menu to automatically select sizes tailored for certain sites like Dribbble, Facebook, etc.
* Shots are stored in the Documents\Snappper folder or to the clipboard

I've been using it heavily for the past few months but it has only been tested on Windows 8.1 & Windows 10 so consider this a Beta version.

If you just want to use Snappper without compiling it yourself: 
* Download files from Setup/Debug
* Run setup.exe and follow instructions 
* Look for the new "Snappper" entry in the Start menu and run 
* Use the hamburger menu to change screen sizes
* Click the little camera icon to take a shot
